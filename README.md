## Project Context
This repository contains my individual contribution to a group machine learning project for gesture recognition using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). 

My Specific Contribution: Method 3 - Scaling Augmentation

## My Contribution: Method 3 Scaling Augmentation
As part of our group project, I was responsible for implementing data augmentation techniques.
I proposed and implemented Method 3: Uniform Scaling Augmentation which:
### What I Implemented:
- Method 3 Scaling: Uniform scaling factor between 0.9 and 1.1
- Combined Approach: Integrated with existing Gaussian noise
